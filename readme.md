# Roll the Dice for Multiplication Practice
Click a button to roll two 12-sided dice to generate two random whole numbers between 1-12. Click a second button to display the product of the two whole numbers just generated.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Lessons Learned:
I wanted the app to provide the product of the two numbers rolled, but not until the user clicked a second button. I first created this as a backend app, but struggled to create a second server response that used the data from the first response. I remade the app here using client-side JavaScript. 

It was much more straightforward to store the result in local storage and display the product after the second button click. I don't have to store values across browser sessions or page refreshing. A database isn't required to store values or inputs.
