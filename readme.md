# Roll the Dice for Multiplication Practice
Click a button to roll two 12-sided dice to generate two random whole numbers between 1-12. Click a second button to display the product of the two whole numbers just generated.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Lessons Learned:
I wanted the app to provide the product of the two numbers rolled, but not until the user clicked a second button. I first created this as a backend app, but struggled to create a second server response that used the data from the first response. I remade the app here using client-side JavaScript.

I was asking myself - Do I need my server to handle the requests and calculations, or can the browser? Do I require a database to store data? Can I create this as a client-side app using local storage to save data between button clicks?
